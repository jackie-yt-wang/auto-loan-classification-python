# Auto Loan Classificataion
A machine learning project with 5 other graduate students and mentored by a senior data scientist from Colombia Threadneedle

### Background Information 
Hi, Welcome to my Github page - Auto Loan Classification Prediction.
As a team, we are predicting an auto loan default classifier with 1 as default and 0 as no default. We are interested also in the profile differences between prime loan borrowers and subprime loan borrowers. 

### Language Used 
- Jupyter Notebook: Python

### Computing Machine Used 
- Google Cloud Platform Virtual Machine (8 vCPUs, 32 GB memory)
- apply *tmux* to prevent VM from crashing 

### Machine Learning Methods Used 
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest 
- XGboost
- Logistics Regression
- Naive Bayes 
- KNN
